## Exercise 2 - Design Session (45 Minutes)
   
   Come up with an app that requires input from a user! This very basic idea has some constraints in this exercise:
   + Your user will be accessing your web page via a mobile device - Think of an app that requires this.
   + Don't make it too complicated - we're focusing on HTML forms, think about the kind of data that you might want to capture with one of these.
   + Your user will be submitting data with a button - what is the maximum amount of data that you can capture from a user in on button press?   
   
   We're looking for answers to the following questions:
   + What would your overall app do?
   + Who is your user?
   + Why do they need to input data?
   + Where are they going to be inputting data?
   + When are they going to be inputting data?
   + How are they going to input data? (Mobile device!!)
   
   Try drawing out wireframes of your app, and form. It's okay to design parts of a page that won't function (menu buttons) as well as think about elements that might enhance your user's experience. Stay focused on the form, though! Try to red-team your app (think about how it might break, or annoy a user), as well as think about all the different types of data that you might want to capture, prior to selecting individual types to capture. Feel free to use the internet and rip off other ideas!

## Exercise 3 - creating your form (2hrs)  

* Create the form that you have wireframed
* Everything that the form captures should be printed to the console when the form is submitted...  
* ... but the form itself should be disabled from its usual behaviour

**Stretch goals**  
  
* Make your form look pretty  
* As well as printing to the console, make the page display the form values below the form when submitted  
 * Add a "clear" button so the user can clear this  
 * What happens to the form itself when the submit button is pressed? Do the values stay there, or do they disappear? What would you like to happen? Make it so.
* Make the whole page display JUST ONE BUTTON. But clicking the button generates the form that you made originally
